# Purpose
This library is intended to be a numerical analysis toolbox, updated as-needed when features are needed for various projects.

# Dependencies
This library uses Eigen 3 for vector and matrix operations. Catch2 is used for unit testing, and its single-header version is contained in this repo for now.

# Tools
Current features of this library include:
-Newton polynomial interpolation
-Polynomial class with monomial basis
-Cubic Hermite interpolation
-Runke-Kutta methods
-root finding with Newton's method
